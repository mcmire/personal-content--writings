[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is my "second brain". It's the tool that I use to keep digital notes and to build a personal knowledge system.

I wanted to document why and how I use Obsidian.

## Why use a "second brain" tool

Let's face it: humans suck at remembering things. 

The goal of a "second brain" tool is simple: to keep a persistent record of your thoughts, ideas, and information you've collected.

It's useful for:

- Research
- Planning
- Journaling
- and more 

Examples:

- You're buying new headphones and you want to keep track of which products you're considering and why and which products you've rejected and why.
- You're reading a book and you want to keep track of your notes. 
- You're playing a challenging video game and you want to keep track of strategies you've taken and approaches you want to try. 
- You're looking for a new job and you want to keep track of where you've applied and where you want to apply.
- You want to keep a diary of important (or everyday) events that have occurred in your life.

## Aside: a brief history of note-taking tools

I have always wanted to be able to write on the go.

In 1997, the Palm Pilot came out. I wanted one but my parents wouldn't let me have one. So in 2000 (?) they got me a digital organizer instead, the [Sharp ZQ-700](https://global.sharp/contents/organizer/software/zq-700/index.html). I was interested in writing at the time and I instantly saw this device as a way that I could write while I was in the car, especially on a long road trip. (Later on, in 2001, I ended up getting a Handspring.)
