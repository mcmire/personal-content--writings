[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is the tool I use to keep digital notes — to jot down thoughts and ideas about life and work, plan side projects, keep a development log, compile research, draft long-form content (such as this post), and more.

I wanted to document why I chose Obsidian over other tools, and how I use it for my needs.

## Why I keep digital notes

I've never been good at remembering details. But since becoming a parent, my time has been more fragmented, and it feels like I'm constantly context-switching. Like Guy Pearson's character in _Memento_, I find it very helpful to write things down so I don't forget them — to offload parts of my brain so that I can refer back to them later.

Proponents of digital notetaking apps like to talk about building a "second brain". I don't know if that's completely accurate

That's oversimplifying a bit, though. I do offload parts of my brain. But zooming out, what I'm really doing is 


 — but I also find it helpful to use them to work out my thoughts in the present.

messages for myself in the future time-traveling tool to record information that I can reference in the future.%%

## Why I use Obsidian

Many note-taking apps exist these days. iOS and macOS come with Apple Notes.

Thanks to Apple Notes (and, to a lesser extent, Google Keep), most people have been exposed to some form of digital notes, even if they might not realize it.

Apps like these are convenient for small use cases: jotting down temporary pieces of information, such as a password, someone's address, or a text message you want to send but you need to perfect first. But there are two reasons why they %%aren't suitable for storing different kinds of knowledge long-term%% are limiting in the long run:

1. Lack of searchability. If you have a thousand notes and you're looking for a specific piece of information, how do you find it?
2. Lack of flexibility. Apple Notes were designed to mimic Post-It notes or index cards, but what about paper? That is, what if you want to capture longer pieces of information? And — going beyond the paper metaphor — what if you want to link one piece of information to another?

A good tool ought to allow for creating a personalized _system_ of digital notes and to provide fundamental ways to organize and search them..



1. What if you want to 

But the ephemeral nature of these apps make them  long-term knowledge, they're not very scalable. 



I don't know about you, but I'm not the best at remembering details. 

If you were to ask me to describe my routine a few days ago, I couldn't tell you what I had for breakfast or whether there were clouds in the sky that day. I have a lot going on

Let's face it: humans suck at remembering things. 

The goal of a "second brain" tool is simple: to keep a persistent record of your thoughts, ideas, and information you've collected.

It's useful for:

- Research
- Planning
- Journaling
- and more 

Examples:

- You're buying new headphones and you want to keep track of which products you're considering and why and which products you've rejected and why.
- You're reading a book and you want to keep track of your notes. 
- You're playing a challenging video game and you want to keep track of strategies you've taken and approaches you want to try. 
- You're looking for a new job and you want to keep track of where you've applied and where you want to apply.
- You want to keep a diary of important (or everyday) events that have occurred in your life.

## Aside: a brief history of note-taking tools

I have always wanted to be able to write on the go.

In 1997, the Palm Pilot came out. I wanted one but my parents wouldn't let me have one. So in 2000 (?) they got me a digital organizer instead, the [Sharp ZQ-700](https://global.sharp/contents/organizer/software/zq-700/index.html). I was interested in writing at the time and I instantly saw this device as a way that I could write while I was in the car, especially on a long road trip. (Later on, in 2001, I ended up getting a Handspring.)
