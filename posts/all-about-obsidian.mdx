[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is the tool I use to keep digital notes — to jot down thoughts and ideas about life and work, plan side projects, keep a development log, compile research, draft articles like these, and more.

I wanted to document why I chose Obsidian over other tools, and how I use it for my needs.

## Why I keep digital notes

I've never been good at remembering details, but as a semi-recent parent, my time is pretty fragmented these days, and it feels like I'm constantly context-switching. Like Guy Pearson's character in _Memento_, I find it very helpful to write things down so I don't forget them.

So I primarily use digital notes as a way of recording information I can use in the future. But I also use them to work out my thoughts in the present. Either way, I am building a network of my personal knowledge.

## Why I use Obsidian

Most people I know aren't strangers to some form of digital notes, even if they might not realize it, thanks to Apple Notes (and, to a lesser extent, Google Keep).

Apps like these are super convenient for jotting down temporary pieces of information, such as a password, someone's address, or a text message you want to send but you need to perfect first. However, they aren't suitable for storing different kinds of knowledge long-term.

The first issue is searchability. If you have a thousand notes and you're looking for a specific piece of information, how do you find it?

The second issue is inflexibility. Apple Notes were designed to mimic Post-It notes or index cards, but what about paper? That is, what if you want to capture longer pieces of information? And — going beyond the paper metaphor — what if you want to link one piece of information to another?

A good tool ought to allow for creating a personalized _system_ of digital notes and to provide fundamental ways to organize and search them.

But the ephemeral nature of these apps make them  long-term knowledge, they're not very scalable. 



I don't know about you, but I'm not the best at remembering details. 

If you were to ask me to describe my routine a few days ago, I couldn't tell you what I had for breakfast or whether there were clouds in the sky that day. I have a lot going on

Let's face it: humans suck at remembering things. 

The goal of a "second brain" tool is simple: to keep a persistent record of your thoughts, ideas, and information you've collected.

It's useful for:

- Research
- Planning
- Journaling
- and more 

Examples:

- You're buying new headphones and you want to keep track of which products you're considering and why and which products you've rejected and why.
- You're reading a book and you want to keep track of your notes. 
- You're playing a challenging video game and you want to keep track of strategies you've taken and approaches you want to try. 
- You're looking for a new job and you want to keep track of where you've applied and where you want to apply.
- You want to keep a diary of important (or everyday) events that have occurred in your life.

## Aside: a brief history of note-taking tools

I have always wanted to be able to write on the go.

In 1997, the Palm Pilot came out. I wanted one but my parents wouldn't let me have one. So in 2000 (?) they got me a digital organizer instead, the [Sharp ZQ-700](https://global.sharp/contents/organizer/software/zq-700/index.html). I was interested in writing at the time and I instantly saw this device as a way that I could write while I was in the car, especially on a long road trip. (Later on, in 2001, I ended up getting a Handspring.)
